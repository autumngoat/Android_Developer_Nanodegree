 *  *
 *  * As part of Udacity Honor code:
 *  *   - I hereby confirm that all project submissions consist of my own work. Accordingly, I will document and cite the origins of any part(s) of my project submissions that were taken from websites, books, forums, blog posts, GitHub repositories, or any other source and explain why I used them for any part of my submission.
 *  *     - Acceptable sources consist of:
 *  *         - Unmodified or modified code from the Udacity courses
 *  *         - A modest amount of unmodified or modified code from third-party sources with attribution
 *  *     - NOT ACCEPTABLE: Any part of another studentâ€™s work, even with attribution
 *  *   - I understand that Udacity will check my submission for plagiarism, and that failure to adhere to the Udacity Honor Code
 *  *   may result in the cancellation of my enrollment without refund.
 *  *   - I understand that I may be asked to explain my work in a video call with a Udacity Representative before my Nanodegree is
 *  *   conferred.
 *  *
 *  * I, the author of the project, allow you to check the code as a reference so long as you are not a fellow Android Developer
 *  * Nanodegree student, but if you submit it, it's your own responsibility if you get expelled.
